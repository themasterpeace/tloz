e given in the following ways:
 *
 * 1. An array of arrays with 4 values. In this case, the values correspond to
 *    to `x,y,length,direction`. If the first value is a string, it is applied
 *    as the name of the point, and the `x` value is inferred.
 *    ```js
 *    data: [
 *        [0, 0, 10, 90],
 *        [0, 1, 5, 180],
 *        [1, 1, 2, 270]
 *    ]
 *    ```
 *
 * 2. An array of objects with named values. The following snippet shows only a
 *    few settings, see the complete options set below. If the total number of
 *    data points exceeds the series'
 *    [turboThreshold](#series.area.turboThreshold), this option is not
 *    available.
 *    ```js
 *    data: [{
 *        x: 0,
 *        y: 0,
 *        name: "Point2",
 *        length: 10,
 *        direction: 90
 *    }, {
 *        x: 1,
 *        y: 1,
 *        name: "Point1",
 *        direction: 270
 *    }]
 *    ```
